 # ðŸ‘‹ Roberto â€” Blockchain Architect & Developer
 
## ðŸ§­ Former preâ€‘sales engineer turned Web3 architect Â· ðŸ”— building secure blockchain systems


I bridge **business needs and engineering**. After a senior pre-sales/architecture track, I moved into hands-on development to build **Web3 dApps** that validate value fast.

- **Focus:** Web3 (Solidity, ZKP Circom ) + Full-stack (Next/React/TypeScript)
- **Also:** Hyperledger Fabric on **Azure**, Docker, wagmi/viem, ethers, Hardhat/Foundry
- **Strength:** self-learner, turning vague requirements into clear specs, then into working software
- **Mode:** remote/hybrid Â· open to relocation with sponsorship
- **Languages:** English, Spanish (native)
