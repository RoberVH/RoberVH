## ðŸ§­ Former preâ€‘sales engineer turned Web3 architect Â· ðŸ”— building secure blockchain systems


I bridge **business needs and engineering**. After a senior pre-sales/architecture track, I moved into hands-on development to build **Web3 dApps** that validate value fast.

- **Focus:** Web3 (Solidity, ZKP Circom ) + Full-stack (Next/React/TypeScript)
- **Also:** Hyperledger Fabric on **Azure**, Docker, wagmi/viem, ethers, Hardhat/Foundry
- **Strength:** self-learner, turning vague requirements into clear specs, then into working software
- **Mode:** remote/hybrid Â· open to relocation with sponsorship
- **Languages:** English, Spanish (native)

## Tech

Solidity Â· Next/React/TypeScript Â· wagmi/viem Â· ethers Â· Hardhat/Foundry Â· Hyperledger Fabric Â· Docker Â· Circom (foundational POCs)

## What Iâ€™m working on now

- Prototyping a demand forecasting & price optimization ML pipeline for retail and wiring smart-contract for supply-chain  
- Exploring zk proof patterns (Circom) and zkTLS-adjacent ideas for privacy-preserving identity and credential checks in Retail/Legal
- Building a minimalist HIIT timer PWA (Next.js/TypeScript/Supabase). Built with AI-assisted development and human-in-the-loop review.
