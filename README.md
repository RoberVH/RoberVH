# ðŸ‘‹ Roberto â€” Blockchain Architect & Developer

## ðŸ§­ Former pre-sales engineer turned Web3 architect Â· ðŸ”— building secure blockchain systems

I bridge **business needs and engineering**. After a senior pre-sales/architecture track, I moved into hands-on development to build **Web3 dApps and full-stack systems** focused on real outcomes.

- **Focus:** Web3 (Solidity, ZK â€” Circom) + Full-stack (Next.js/React/TypeScript)
- **Also:** Hyperledger Fabric on **Azure**, Docker, wagmi/viem, ethers, Hardhat/Foundry
- **Strength:** self-learner, turning vague requirements into clear specs and working software
- **Mode:** remote/hybrid Â· open to relocation with sponsorship
- **Languages:** English, Spanish (native)

## What Iâ€™m working on now

- Prototyping a demand-forecasting & price-optimization ML pipeline for retail, wiring **smart-contract checkpoints** for supply-chain events
- Exploring ZK proof patterns (Circom) and zkTLS-adjacent ideas for privacy-preserving identity and credential checks in Retail/Legal
- Building a minimalist **HIIT timer** PWA (Next.js/TypeScript/Supabase). Built with AI-assisted development and human-in-the-loop review
